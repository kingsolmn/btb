# btb - Bob the Builder
A simple build script to aid in the automation of a CakePHP 
web app deployment as part of a GitLab CI work-flow.


This is intended to extend the original source and add some simple auth to prevent accidental 
triggering. Intended to be used with a private GitLab repo and used as part of the GitLab CI workflow.
